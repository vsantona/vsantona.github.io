Hi there.  
My name is Vincenzo. I didn’t plan to become a software engineer, it just kind of happened and then things got out of control.

I currently work as a **Senior Product Engineer at lastminute.com**, where I build and evolve the distributed systems behind flight booking, pricing and refunding. My day-to-day work is about making sure that millions of searches and bookings flow correctly through a complex ecosystem of providers, microservices and event streams, even when traffic is high and things go wrong.

Before that, I worked at **BMC Software** on a **capacity optimization platform** for on-premises and cloud infrastructure, dealing with large volumes of time-series data and forecasting systems that try to predict the future of servers.

Earlier in my career, I was part of **MotorK**, working on a **real-time automotive platform** that managed hundreds of thousands of vehicles and published ads across dozens of portals every day.

Before MotorK I moved through consulting, telecom and a few other enterprise worlds, where I learned how large systems fail in creative ways and how important it is to design software that can survive in production.

Somewhere along the way, I also fell in love with **distributed systems, event-driven architectures and domain-driven design**, which led me to contribute to **Debezium**, the open-source Change Data Capture platform. I enjoy working in open source because it forces you to think in terms of long-living systems, real users and real problems.

When I’m not in front of a keyboard, I usually go to the gym or spend time with my **three children, two twins and a big brother**. They are my favorite part of every day and a constant reminder that the most important systems are the ones we build at home.
